          census. Western Europeans excepted.

          increase in illegal immigration. Many Europeans who did not
          fall under the quotas migrated to Canada or Mexico, which
          [as Western Hemisphere nations] were not subject to
          national-origin quotas; [and] subsequently they slipped into

          Johnson administration wildly misled the conservatives

          Note:
          from nation of nations: administration officials, however,
          didn't ask members to set aside their prejudice regarding
          non-European immigrants. Apparently thinking that such an
          argument would fall flat, the officials chose to stick with
          their insistence that changing the criteria for admitting
          immigrants would have no consequential effect on the ethnic
          makeup of the immigrant population. In the coming years,
          when their official predictions were shown to have been
          wildly inaccurate, a debate arose over whether Johnson
          admin. officials were misleading in their presentations to
          Congress or simply mistaken.
